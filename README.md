# Deep Learning for Computer Vision

![](graphics/open_pose.gif)

**Deep Learning** has recently changed the landscape of computer vision (and other fields), and is largely responsible for a 3rd wave of interest and excitment about artificial intellgence. In this module we'll cover the basics of deep learning for computer vision.

## GPU Usage & Setup
A significant portion of the code in this repo (especially the fastai parts) will be painfully slow without a GPU. If you don't have access to a physical GPU machine, we recommend renting one. There are some really great/easy/affordable ways to do this, and with a couple platforms (Amazond Web Services, Google Cloud), you are likeley eldigable for free computer credits as a student. [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/start_salamander.html) has a really nice summary of the avaible cloud platforms for this type of thing, along with setup instructions. A number of services come with fastai already installed, which makes life even easier!
